# A Multi-Cloud Application

### Stack

1. AWS S3 Bucket
2. AWS DynamoDB
3. Azure SQL Server
4. Azure Dotnet Web application


### NoSQL provider Explanation

We selected Amazon DynamoDB over Azure Cosmos DB due to three key factors: the IAM roles capabilities, data encryption point to point, and pricing; the billing by usage is more suitable considering our business model. 

For a more detailed comparison between both services, you can refer [to this article](https://dynobase.dev/dynamodb-vs-cosmos/)
